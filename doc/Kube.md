## Kubernetes Deployment for Time Manager Batman

### 1. What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for deploying, managing, and scaling applications in a containerized environment.

### 2. Why Use Kubernetes?

Kubernetes offers several benefits, including:

- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications up or down based on demand.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensures high availability by distributing applications across multiple nodes.
- **Container Orchestration:** Manages the lifecycle of containerized applications, including deployment, scaling, and updates.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Optimizes resource utilization, allowing for efficient use of infrastructure.

### 3. Deploying Back-end, Front-end, and Database

To deploy your back-end, front-end, and database using Kubernetes, follow these general steps:

- Create Kubernetes deployment files (`deployment.yaml`) for each component.
- Apply the deployment files using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
- Monitor the deployment status with `kubectl get pods`.

### 4. Configuring Traefik with Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. To configure Traefik using Helm:

- Install Helm on your Kubernetes cluster.
- Add the Traefik Helm repository: `helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik`
- Install Traefik with your desired configuration: `helm install traefik traefik/traefik -f traefik-values.yaml`

### 5. Deploying the Site

To access your deployed site, you need to update your hosts file. Run the following commands:


Linux:
```bash

echo '188.166.139.113 pop.time-manager-batman.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo '188.166.139.113 www.time-manager-batman.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Windows:
```bash
echo 188.166.139.113 pop.time-manager-batman.com >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
echo 188.166.139.113 www.time-manager-batman.com >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```
